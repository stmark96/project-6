              Tim Berners-Lee, a scientist and academic, was the primary author
              of HTML, with the assistance of his colleagues at CERN, an
              international scientific organization based in Geneva. The first
              version of HTML was formally published in June 1993<time

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          As someone who loves web design, web development, cars, music, and
          family, I feel incredibly fulfilled and passionate about the various
          areas of my life. When it comes to web design and development, I find
          it incredibly satisfying to create websites that are both visually
          appealing and highly functional, allowing me to showcase my creative
          and technical skills simultaneously. As for my love of cars, I am
          constantly fascinated by the engineering behind these incredible
          machines and enjoy learning about how they work. Music has always been
          a deeply emotional and powerful force in my life, and I find solace in
          exploring the artistry and creativity of different musicians and
          genres. Finally, family is the foundation of my life and I cherish the
          connections and relationships that I have with the people I love most.
          Overall, my passions are diverse, but they all bring me a sense of
          joy, purpose, and fulfillment in their own unique ways.
